You’re a corporate wage-slave in a satirical idle game where you work a 9-5, gamble in absurd casino mini-games, and juggle risk between your wallet, bank, and the market.
Progress isn’t just luck — you manage Social Credit, upgrades, properties, and timing to climb from intern to CEO while dodging bad decisions and exploiting good ones.
It’s a darkly funny grind about modern work culture, where smart risk management beats blind gambling.
