## 🚀 PATCH NOTES V5.2: THE BRAINROT ASCENSION

### 🔐 Security & Integrity
*   **Android Pattern Unlock:** Replaced basic login with an interactive 3x3 pattern unlock system. 3 failed attempts trigger a 60s lockout with a live countdown.
*   **Emergency Recovery:** One-time 3-word brainrot phrases (e.g., `SKIBIDI-OHIO-RIZZ`) are provided during setup.
*   **Atomic Transactions:** Every transaction is processed server-side via PostgreSQL RPCs to prevent double-spending and race conditions.
*   **PvP Integrity:** Coinflip and Deathrolls now use a strict **Invite/Accept** flow to prevent griefing.

### 👑 The Prestige & Property Endgame
*   **Flee The Country:** Achieve a **$1,000,000 Net Worth** to reset progress and earn permanent **Legendary Status**.
*   **Prestige Ranks:** Earn titles like **Ex-Patriot 🌴**, **Offshore Mogul 🏦**, **Global Elite 🍷**, **Shadow Ruler 👁️**, and **Intergalactic Rizzler 🪐**.
*   **Permanent Buffs:** Each Prestige Tier grants **+5% Permanent Luck** and a **+500 Social Credit floor** (max 1500).
*   **Property Ownership:** Buy **The Bank** ($500k) or **The Casino** ($750k) to earn a **1% commission** on global transactions.
    *   *Warning:* Owners must pay a daily **$10,000 Land Tax** or face property seizure.

### 📈 Wolf of Meme Street
*   **Meme Stocks:** Added **$GME, $DOGE, and $PEPE**.
*   **Trend Logic:** Assets follow market cycles (**BULL, BEAR, MOON, CRASH**) rather than random noise.
*   **Rug Pulls:** 0.5% chance for a devastating **80% Market Crash** on any security.
*   **Portfolio P/L:** Live tracking of Average Cost Basis and real-time gains/losses.

### 🧠 Active Grind & Engagement
*   **Bureaucratic Busywork:** Work is interrupted every 10-15 clicks by mandatory tasks (Recycle TPS reports, Resolve HR Audits, Settle CEO Lawsuits).
*   **Re-Education Camp:** If Social Credit hits **0**, you are locked out of work until you pass a brainrot quiz at the Re-Education Center.
*   **Productivity Spikes:** 1% chance while working to hit a **100x Wage Spike**.
*   **Daily Login Streaks:** Earn escalating cash bonuses and track your streak via the header flame indicator.

### 🚔 Law & Order (SEC Heat)
*   **Heat Accumulation:** High-tier jobs (CEO) and Offshore Accounts generate **SEC Heat**.
*   **Dynamic Audits:** High Heat = High risk of an IRS Audit (**50% Bank Wipe**).
*   **Stress Relief:** Clicking the **Beer** icon reduces Heat Level by -50 points.

### 📎 The Meta Glitch
*   **Fake BSOD:** Random chance on loss to trigger a Blue Screen of Death.
*   **Meme CAPTCHA:** Type *"I AM A WAGE SLAVE"* to regain access after a crash.
